                    <h3>How I stay commited to learning</h3>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, the try to create simple projects
                        using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. Its so fascinating to see progress and the development of my person as programmer.
                    </p>
                    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                    <h3>How I got started</h3>
                    <p>It start long time ago into my childhood, when I discovered computers and I knew I will be working someday with it.
                        Coding started simple I was learning from scratch and it was amazing to learn new things, it has some downfall, but about that some other day.
                        I would take notes of what I learned and use them to summaries the things I learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p>That helped me grok what I was learning and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
